## Explaining the Core Code and Functionalities

CodeSphere has three main functionalities:

#### 1. Automated Evaluation
 Our platform incorporates a machine learning model to generate readability scores for student code, ensuring not just correctness but also code quality. Integration with the free GPT-3.5 API enables personalized feedback, guiding students to enhance their coding skills. Professors benefit from automated code testing, eliminating the need for manual evaluation. 
 
 Our compiler efficiently runs test cases, providing instant results on the number of cases passed. This not only saves valuable time for professors but also delivers prompt feedback to students, creating a seamless and effective evaluation experience.

#### 2. Tailored Testing
 CodeSphere generates custom test cases, empowering professors with the ability to receive random test cases tailored to their questions. This allows fair judgment and comprehensive evaluation of the submitted code, enhancing the effectiveness of coding assessments.


#### 3. Enhanced Security Measures
 CodeSphere enhances security by disabling copy-pasting, ensuring the authenticity of submissions. Alerts are triggered for tab switching during evaluations, maintaining a controlled assessment environment. These measures contribute to a secure and fair evaluation process for both students and educators.

CodeSphere offers a straightforward interface with separate portals for students and professors. Professors can easily create questions, assignments, and evaluations, while students access and complete assessments effortlessly. The platform's design focuses on simplicity, ensuring a smooth process for both educators and learners.
